# COMPRESSIFIRE
With the advancement in technology people are nowadays more focused towards technology so that they can get better and efficient results and new technology so that they can maximise the space and can work at low bit rate of Internet speed.So, the project mainly aims to minimize the usage of space while uploading and retrieving images. As the size of the image will be reduced and hence low bit rate will be required for uploading and retrieving image.The approach will be to use Autoencoders and GAN to compress and decompress the images .The dataset we used to train our model is the Fashion-MNIIST dataset. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando 's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
